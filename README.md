# CourageOS
CourageOS is a session created using Devuan, made for lightness and fun.

I wanted to do a study in this way on a series that was watched and loved in the past.

It was done in 1.5 hours. so there may be some errors.

I do not intend to develop it in the future, because I did it out of boredom.

It can be used for low systems that want it. There are not many packages installed in it.

You can only use it via USB.

"refractainstaller" would take a long time to configure on this issue, I didn't want to deal with it so I found a solution in this way.

Nobody wants to use a template made for entertainment purposes as the main os, right?

Then there is no need for the installer.

# Neofetch
I added the session-related ascii logo to the content of the file at https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch

# Slim
source slim theme: https://github.com/adi1090x/slim_themes/tree/master/themes/minimal

I used the slim manager for auto login.

I used slimlock instead of i3lock because it's better at customizing.

# i3-wm
I used i3-wm because I wanted it to be light.

I used polybar instead of i3bar. The i3bar by itself looks very rough and old, also the polybar is easier to customize.

# i3-wm keyboard shortcuts
mod key = alt

alt+t = rofi

alt+c = pcmanfm

other shortcuts are the same

# Applications
Applications list = pcmanfm -> menu://applications/

# Username and password
root -> courage

courage -> courage
